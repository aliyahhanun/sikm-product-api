        }
    }
]
```

#### Feat 2: Get product detail
- Should return status code `200` when product with given id found in database.
- Product detail should get product data with it's category and the user/creator of the product.
- Should return status code `404` when product with given id not found in database.

API Contract: `GET /product/:id`, sample response:
```
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Beng-beng",
    "price": 2500,
    "poster": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "role": "ADMIN",
        "email": "john.doe@mail.com"
    },
    "category": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Snack"
    }
}
```

#### Feat 3: Post product
- Should return status code `201 (Created)` when insert data success.
- Request payload should be validated with [gin validator](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/examples/binding-and-validation/), the requirement is on  payload sample below. When the validation error should return status code `400`.
- Product's name should not contains words like "termurah", "terbaik", "diskon", and "promo". 
- When `category_id` or `posted_by` id is not exist in DB (ForeignKeyViolation sql error state `23503`), it should return error status code 400. For others postgres error code can be read [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html).

API Contract: `POST /product/add`, sample response:
```
{
    "message": "product added"
}
```

Sample request payload and the validation:
```
{
    "name": "Ayam Geprek", // required, min length 8 chars
    "price": 7000, // required, price more than 0
    "category_id": 1, // required
    "posted_by": 1 // required
}
```

#### [CHALLENGE] Feat 4: Update product by ID
- Should be able to update data in product include these fields: name, price, and category_id. Please create new `DTO` for the request payload.
- Product's name should not contains words like "termurah", "terbaik", "diskon", and "promo". 
- Should return status code `200` when update success.
- When product with the given `id` not found in DB, API should return response status code `404`.
- When `category_id` is not exist in DB (ForeignKeyViolation sql error state `23503`), it should return error status code 400. For others postgres error code can be read [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html).

API Contract: `PUT /product/update/:id`, sample response:
```
{
    "message": "product updated"
}
```

Sample request payload and the validation:
```
{
    "name": "Ayam Geprek", // required, min length 8 chars
    "price": 7000, // required, price more than 0
    "category_id": 1 // required
}
```

#### [CHALLENGE] Feat 5: Delete product by ID

```

### Session 2: Middleware & JWT Authentication
Session based authentication:

Token based (JWT) authentication:
<img src="token-based.png">

Ref: 
- https://jerrynsh.com/all-to-know-about-auth-and-cookies/#:~:text=JWT%20is%20simply%20a%20token,within%20your%20browser's%20Cookies%20storage.
- https://hackernoon.com/using-session-cookies-vs-jwt-for-authentication-sd2v3vci

Objectives during session:
- [ ] Understand concept of middleware
- [ ] Implement [middleware](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/blob/master/docs/doc.md#using-middleware) in Gin
- [ ] Understand [JWT authentication](https://jwt.io/introduction)
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication and integrate with cookie
- [ ] Implement JWT validation
- [ ] Using gin context to carry data between middleware in a request

#### Feat 1: Login and generate JWT token
- Should response cookie with key `session_token`, active for 15 minutes, and `http only` cookie when email and password is valid.
- JWT payload should contain required fields (check below JWT payload example), we will use package [go-jwt](github.com/golang-jwt/jwt) and follow [generate-token snippet](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5#example-New-Hmac).
- Should validate request body with gin validator.
- Should return error `400` when user by email is not found.
- Should return error `400` when password is wrong.

API Contract: `POST /user/login`, sample response:
```
// Response Body
{
    "message": "login success"
}
```

Sample request payload and the validation:
```
{
    "email": "john.doe@mail.com", // required, valid email
    "password": "123456", // required, min length 6
}
```

Sample JWT payload:
```
{
  "iss": "product-api.com",
  "user_id": "1",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
  "iat": 1618985752,
  "exp": 1618986952,
  "scope": "user admin"
}
```

#### Feat 2: Token validation
Below is the Authorization rules/access on our API base on user's role:
- Unauthorized: client don't need to authenticated to access this API
    - `POST /user/login`
- Authorized User: client must be logged in and have role/scope `USER` or `ADMIN`.
    - `GET /product/list`
    - `GET /product/:id`
- Authorized Admin: client must be logged in and have role `ADMIN`.
    - `POST /product/add`
    - `PUT /product/:id`
    - `DELETE /product/:id`

Read docs on [how to validate token](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5#example-Parse-Hmac).

### Session 3: Deployment
